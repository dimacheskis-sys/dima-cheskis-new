About
======
Dr. **Dima Cheskis** is a condensed‑matter experimental physicist specializing in **magneto‑optical and transport phenomena in topological materials**, particularly **ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals** such as Co₃Sn₂S₂.  
He leads research in **magneto‑optical Kerr effect (MOKE)**, **anomalous Hall effect (AHE)**, and **magnetoresistance** at the *Magneto‑Optics Laboratory*.  
His recent work focuses on **chiral qubits**, **Berry‑curvature‑driven effects**, and **quantum materials characterization** through combined optical and electronic probes.
