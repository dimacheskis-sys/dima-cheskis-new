**Abstract**

Single-exciton, biexciton, triexciton, and quadraexciton bands were resolved in the micro-photoluminescence spectrum of a single CdTe/CdSe core–shell colloidal quantum dot, revealing nearly blinking-free behavior.  
Multiexcitons were generated by sequential filling of electronic shells with increasing continuous-wave excitation power, and their populations were evaluated under steady-state conditions.  
Partial carrier delocalization at the core–shell interface and exciton binding energies were estimated via second-order perturbation theory.  
This observation provides direct evidence of suppressed Auger recombination in quasitype-II CdTe/CdSe dots, advancing their applicability in optoelectronic and biological devices.
