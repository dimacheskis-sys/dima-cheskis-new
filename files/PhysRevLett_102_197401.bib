  abstract  = {Single-exciton, biexciton, triexciton, and quadraexciton bands were resolved in the micro-photoluminescence spectrum of a single CdTe/CdSe core-shell colloidal quantum dot, revealing nearly blinking-free behavior. Multiexcitons were generated by sequential filling of electronic shells with increasing continuous-wave excitation power, and their probability was evaluated under steady-state conditions. A partial carrier delocalization was determined at the core-shell interface, and exciton binding energy estimated by a second-order perturbation theory.}
